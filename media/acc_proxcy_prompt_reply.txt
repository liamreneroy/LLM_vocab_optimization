>>>>>>>>> PROMPT <<<<<<<<<<<

You are an expert roboticist and understand how to design communicative expressions for human-robot interaction.

Consider a scenario where you are collaborating with a dog-shaped quadruped robot to locate and pick strawberries in a strawberry patch.

In this scenario, the robot can be in one of 5 possible states. The data in this list is in the format: "State Number: [State Name, State Description]"

S04: [Needs Help, The robot is experiencing an error and needs help from the user]

S05: [Confused, The robot is confused and unsure what to do]

S02: [Analyzing Object, The robot is analyzing a target object in front of it on the ground]

S01: [Waiting for Input, The robot is in standby mode waiting for a command from the user]

S03: [Found Object, The robot has found a target object in front of it on the ground]

S06: [Unsure, It is unclear as the robot does not appear to be in any of the described states.]

—————————

Below is a description of the robot using its body pose to express its internal state:

In this scenario, the dog-shaped quadruped robot tilts its torso to the left and leans it forward, maintaining this position for 8 seconds.

—————————

Your task:

Please estimate what state you think the robot is in based on this description. If none of the states seem to match the description, select 'Unsure'.

Your response must be a single line in the exact format shown below (see example and reference):

[State_Number, State_Name]

Reference: 
State_Number = number of the selected robot state (e.g. S01)
State_Name = name of the selected robot state (e.g. Analyzing Object)
