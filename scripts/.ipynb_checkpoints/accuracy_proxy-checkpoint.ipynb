    "**Frequency_penalty**: Number between -2 and 2, where higher numbers penalize new tokens based on their frequency to that point in the response. The higher the number, the lower the probability of repetition. This parameter penalizes repeated tokens in the output, making responses more diverse and creative. Suggestion: Use a low frequency penalty (e.g., 0.0–0.2) to reduce redundancy but still allow the model to use relevant tokens multiple times where necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Top-p (Nucleus Sampling)**: This parameter determines the probability mass considered for each token in the output. A lower top-p (e.g., 0.7) will cause the model to sample from only the more likely tokens, while a top-p of 1.0 will consider all possible outcomes. Suggestion: Set the top_p to 0.8–0.9 to introduce some controlled randomness while still keeping the majority of the likelihood in more probable tokens, ensuring coherent responses. ~~~~~  Higher top_p values (closer to 1): This will include a broader range of possible tokens, increasing diversity and randomness, making the behaviour more stochastic (i.e., less predictable). A value of top_p = 1 means the model can sample from the full probability distribution, leading to more creative and unpredictable results.\n",
    "Lower top_p values (closer to 0): This restricts the sampling to a smaller subset of tokens (those with the highest probability), leading to more deterministic and conservative outputs, i.e., less stochastic behavior. For example, setting top_p = 0.1 would mean the model will only consider the most probable 10% of tokens.\n",
