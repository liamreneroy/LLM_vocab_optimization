    "## OpenAI API Details and Hyper-Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "**Models**: The model you want to use (i.e. \"gpt-4-turbo\", \"gpt-4\", \"gpt-4o\", \"gpt-4o-mini\" or \"gpt-3.5-turbo\")\n",
    "\n",
    "**Message**: The message being sent (the prompt)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Temperature**: Number between 0 and 1, can be adjusted when calling the OpenAI API to control the randomness of the output generated by the language model. It determines how \"creative\" or \"conservative\" the responses are. A temperature of 1.0 means the model generates text with standard randomness, while a lower temperature (closer to 0.0) will make it more deterministic. Suggestion: Set the temperature to a moderate value, around 0.2 to 0.5. This will give you some randomness, mimicking the variability in human input, but still maintain enough accuracy to ensure that the responses are meaningful. **In the case of our work, we held this constant at a value of 0.2 to get slight stochasticity.** \n",
    "\n",
    "**Frequency_penalty**: Number between -2 and 2, where higher numbers penalize new tokens based on their frequency to that point in the response. The higher the number, the lower the probability of repetition. This parameter penalizes repeated tokens in the output, making responses more diverse and creative. Suggestion: Use a low frequency penalty (e.g., 0.0 to 0.2) to reduce redundancy but still allow the model to use relevant tokens multiple times where necessary. **In the case of our work, we held this constant at a value of 0.0.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Top-p (Nucleus Sampling)**: This parameter determines the probability mass considered for each token in the output. A lower top-p (e.g., 0.7) will cause the model to sample from only the more likely tokens, while a top-p of 1.0 will consider all possible outcomes. Suggestion: Set the top_p to 0.8â€“0.9 to introduce some controlled randomness while still keeping the majority of the likelihood in more probable tokens, ensuring coherent responses. ~~~~~  Higher top_p values (closer to 1): This will include a broader range of possible tokens, increasing diversity and randomness, making the behaviour more stochastic (i.e., less predictable). A value of top_p = 1 means the model can sample from the full probability distribution, leading to more creative and unpredictable results.\n",
    "Lower top_p values (closer to 0): This restricts the sampling to a smaller subset of tokens (those with the highest probability), leading to more deterministic and conservative outputs, i.e., less stochastic behavior. For example, setting top_p = 0.1 would mean the model will only consider the most probable 10% of tokens."
